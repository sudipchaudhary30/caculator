        You burst through the door
        wheeling your red Swiss
        Army suitcase—how had
        you packed all you needed
        in that for eight months?
        —and I, in my stained yoga pants,
        stood gaping with delight
        (my little red paring knife
        in one hand and a yellow
        apple in the other).</pre>
